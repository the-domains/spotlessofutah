  When I started Spotless of Utah, now Blueox, in 2006, I simply had dreams of
  paying off my student loan debt. While my company helped that cause, my dreams
  have evolved tremendously. As president of Blueox, I’ve become driven to build
  a company that provides the best janitorial services and customer service
  experiences for clients nationwide. Through partnering with clients and
  communities, I’m working to build a company that people respect and love,
  whether they’re working with us as clients or for us as employees.
