NICK SANDERS | PRESIDENT

When I started Spotless of Utah, in 2006, I simply had dreams of paying off my student loan debt. While my company helped that cause, my dreams have evolved tremendously. As president of Spotless of Utah, I've become driven to build a company that provides the best janitorial services and customer service experiences for clients nationwide. Through partnering with clients and communities, I'm working to build a company that people respect and love, whether they're working with us as clients or for us as employees.

CHAD ROPER | VICE PRESIDENT

Spotless is my pride and joy. As vice president of our company, I wholeheartedly believe our success, and our future, will be built on a foundation rooted in trust, value and communication. These are at the heart of everything we do as a company, and they motivate our teams of cleaning specialists, quality assurance personnel and our clients. We strive to make every customer a fan of the services we provide them, and we'll never tire of that mission.

JACKIE SANDERS  
DIRECTOR OF HUMAN RESOURCES

As Nick's wife, when I said "I do" to my husband, I said "I do" to Spotless. Marry an owner, marry a company! Luckily, our shared passion for Spotless makes us passionately and equally committed to our employees and our customers. I'm so thankful to have been given the opportunity to bring my background in payroll administration and human resources to the company. It's important to me that our incredible employees know how much their positive contributions to Blueox are valued and appreciated. They truly make everything that we do for our clients possible.
